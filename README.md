# 🏪 BigMart Sales Prediction — Analysis and Modeling
## 📘 Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting sales for the BigMart retail chain using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains various attributes of items and outlets, such as item type, weight, visibility, MRP, outlet size, and establishment year.
Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model building, this study aims to uncover patterns that influence sales and to develop a predictive model capable of estimating future sales for given product and store combinations.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and relationships among variables.
- Handle missing values and perform feature engineering to improve data quality.
- Apply machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost) to predict item sales.
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate regression metrics such as RMSE and R².
- Generate insights to support data-driven business decisions for retail sales optimization.

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training & Evaluation
- Visualization of Results

## 💡 Key Insights

The analysis helps identify how product characteristics (like MRP and visibility) and store attributes (like outlet size and type) influence total sales, offering actionable insights for pricing, inventory management, and store performance improvement.
